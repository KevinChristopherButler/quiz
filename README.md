# Quiz Application

This is an interactive quiz application built on HTML/CSS and JavaScript. The site offers a choice of four quiz
categories. By default, the "football category" is displayed initially.

The application is aimed at the casual viewer, a means of passing some 'down time'. The multiple choice aspect
ensures that specialist knowledge is not required to complete any category.


## Features

- The site offers a choice of four quiz categories viz. Football, History, Literature and Science.
- There are five multiple-choice questions associated with each category.
- The application maintains a count of correct and incorrect responses per category, as well as the overall score over all categories.
- A user may also enter a name to add a personal note to the screen messages.
- The site is fully responsive.


## Testing

### Validator Testing

### HTML
The HTML check (https://validator.w3.org) shows three warning messages. Two of these are "empty heading" messages. This is acceptable as the headings in question are populated by the JavaScript processing. The third warning states that it is unnecessary to specify the file type when referencing the JavaScript script file itself. I prefer to include the file type in all cases. 

### CSS
No errors were found by the Jigsaw validator (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator).

### Accessibility
Lighthouse showed an accessibility score of 100.
