# Quiz Application

This is an interactive quiz application built on HTML/CSS and JavaScript. The site offers a choice of four quiz
categories. By default, the "football category" is displayed initially.

The application is aimed at the casual viewer, a means of passing some 'down time'. The multiple choice aspect
ensures that specialist knowledge is not required to complete any category.


## Features

- The site offers a choice of four quiz categories viz. Football, History, Literature and Science.
- There are five multiple-choice questions associated with each category.
- The application maintains a count of correct and incorrect responses per category, as well as the overall score over all categories.
- A user may also enter a name to add a personal note to the screen messages.
- The site is fully responsive.


## Testing

### Validator Testing

- HTML
Each page showed a warning message: "Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements.....".
I am inclined to leave this alone since the section is contained within an article element which has a header.

- CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator.

- Accessibility
Lighthouse showed an accessibility score of ???.
